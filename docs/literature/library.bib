abstract = {Integrated Design of Multiscale, Multifunctional Materials and Products is the first of its type to consider not only design of materials, but concurrent design of materials and products. In other words, materials are not just selected on the basis of properties, but the composition and/or microstructure iw designed to satisfy specific ranged sets of performance requirements. This book presents the motivation for pursuing concurrent design of materials and products, thoroughly discussing the details of multiscale modeling and multilevel robust design and provides details of the design methods/strategies along with selected examples of designing material attributes for specified system performance. It is intended as a monograph to serve as a foundational reference for instructors of courses at the senior and introductory graduate level in departments of materials science and engineering, mechanical engineering, aerospace engineering and civil engineering who are interested in next generation systems-based design of materials.Key Features:* First of its kind to consider not only design of materials, but concurrent design of materials and products.* Treatment of uncertainty via robust design of materials* Integrates the "materials by design approach" of Olson/Ques Tek LLC with the "materials selection" approach of Ashby/Granta* Distinquishes the processes of concurrent design of materials and products as an overall systems design problem from the field of multiscale modeling* Systematic mathematical algorithms and methods are introduced for robust design of materials, rather than ad hoc heuristics--it is oriented towards a true systems approach to design of materials and products},

abstract = {The orientation distribution function (ODF) is most commonly described in the Bunge–Euler space using generalized spherical harmonics (GSH) as a Fourier basis. In this paper, we explore critically the relative advantages and disadvantages of using an alternate description of the ODF using the much more readily accessible discrete Fourier transforms (DFTs). Appropriate protocols to address the consideration of crystal and sample symmetries in the DFT representations of ODFs have been developed and validated in this paper. It was also observed that the representation of first-order texture-elastic property linkages using DFTs needed a higher number of terms compared to the GSH representations. However, the use of DFT representations resulted in major computational economy in producing the ODF plots as well as the delineation of the property closures. It is shown that the improved computational efficiency facilitated the delineation of the first-order elastic property closures involving the normal–shear coupling stiffness coefficients.},

abstract = {A probabilistic finite element scheme is presented for simulating evolution of polycrystalline microstructures during deformation. The microstructure is described using conditional orientation correlation function (COCF), defined as the probability density of occurrence of a crystal orientation g′ at a distance r from a given orientation g. The COCF is represented using three interconnected layers of finite element meshes in the g′, r and g spaces. As the microstructure evolves, the reoriented neighborhood and strain fields close to an orientation (g) are captured by updating probability fields in these finite element meshes. For this purpose, a novel total Lagrangian approach has been developed that allows evolution of probability densities while satisfying normalization constraints, probability interdependencies and symmetries. The improvement in prediction of texture and strains achieved by the COCF approach over ODF-based methods is quantified through deformation analysis of a planar polycrystalline microstructure.},

abstract = {Computational and experimental methodologies are integrated into a novel combined technique to define microstructure design criteria and maximize the properties of rhombohedral Bi0.5Na0.4K0.1TiO3, from untextured (1 MRD), d33 = 155pC/N, to textured (4.41 MRDs), d33 = 227pC/N. Two-dimensional orientation maps obtained using electron backscatter diffraction on sequential parallel layers are used to computationally reconstruct three-dimensional samples, simulate the local piezoelectric grain interactions, and thus demonstrate that superior lead-free piezoelectric microstructures can be fabricated by engineering its associated crystallographic and polarization texture. Computer-generated material representations, based on the experimentally determined microstructures, were used to simulate the crystallographic orientation of each grain, as function a macroscopic polarization and crystallographic texture. Computer-generated material representations, based on the experimentally determined microstructures, were used to simulate the crystallographic orientation of each grain, as function a macroscopic polarization and crystallographic texture. The method takes advantage of the anisotropy of the properties of the underlying single-crystal phases and delivers a guide to search for material anisotropy |microstructure parameters that are optimal in piezoelectric performance and reliability, and thus establish practical links between structure and macroscopic length scales.},

abstract = {Manufacturing process modeling is gaining importance in view of stiff global competition to produce the goods of specified design in an optimal way. In particular, metal forming and machining (both traditional and non-traditional) have been extensively modeled using numerical techniques. Three basic steps of modeling of manufacturing processes are analytical representation of working principle of the process, modeling of material behavior and method of solution. In this paper, a comprehensive review of various approaches of material behavior modeling has been presented. The material behavior modeling has great influence on the design of process, tools and the final product. This aspect is highlighted in the present review. Metal forming processes, traditional machining processes and non-traditional machining processes are considered for the study. Different material models are compared with respect to their suitability for the design of process, tooling and product. Finally, the paper suggests the directions for further research in this area.},

abstract = {The study addresses the perturbation-based stochastic finite element analysis and the robust design optimization of deformation processes of inelastic solids. The perturbation equations for the stochastic moment analysis of both steady-state and non-stationary processes are presented. An iteration scheme based on the secant system operator is given for the solution of the perturbation equations in case that a tangent matrix is not available. The robust design of deformation processes is stated as a two-criteria optimal design problem that attempts best mean properties of the outcome at minimum variability. The task is solved using optimization techniques based on sequential quadratic programming in conjunction with the stochastic finite element analysis. The proposed method is applied to the design of an extrusion die for robustness with respect to friction variability, and to a workpiece preform design problem. The numerical results show the potential of the method for applications regarding the design of robust deformation processes.},

@article{Yih1981,
abstract = {This chapter focuses on variational and related methods for the overall properties of composites. A wide range of phenomena that are observable macroscopically are governed by partial differential equations that are linear and self-adjoint. This chapter is concerned with such phenomena for materials, such as fiber-reinforced composites or polycrystals, whose properties vary in a complicated fashion from point to point over a small, “microscopic” length scale, while they appear “on average” (that is, relative to the larger, macroscopic scale) to be uniform. This chapter treats the elastic behavior of composites, and emphasizes that a number of other properties (conductivity, viscosity of a suspension, etc.) are described by the same equations. Extensions to viscoelastic and thermoelastic behavior are presented, for both of which the variational characterization given is believed to be new. Problems, such as the resistance to flow of viscous fluid through a fixed bed of particles are mentioned, and a model problem that involves diffusion is presented in some detail. This displays the same difficulty in relation to divergence of an integral and is one problem of this type that has so far been approached variationally. Methods related to the Hashin–Shtrikman variational principle are also described in the chapter.},

abstract = {It is supposed that a region within an isotropic elastic solid undergoes a spontaneous change of form which, if the surrounding material were absent, would be some prescribed homogeneous deformation. Because of the presence of the surrounding material stresses will be present both inside and outside the region. The resulting elastic field may be found very simply with the help of a sequence of imaginary cutting, straining and welding operations. In particular, if the region is an ellipsoid the strain inside it is uniform and may be expressed in terms of tabulated elliptic integrals. In this case a further problem may be solved. An ellipsoidal region in an infinite medium has elastic constants different from those of the rest of the material; how does the presence of this inhomogeneity disturb an applied stress-field uniform at large distances? It is shown that to answer several questions of physical or engineering interest it is necessary to know only the relatively simple elastic field inside the ellipsoid.},

abstract = {The effect of crystallographic textures on the formability of BCC steel sheets has been studied by using crystalline plasticity finite element analysis (FEA) and experiments. It was confirmed that one of the important reasons why the conventional high-strength steel sheet has poor formability was due to lack of \{111\} fiber texture components —$\gamma$-fiber texture—. In this paper, a texture adjusted design method is proposed to improve the formability of conventional high-strength steel sheets. First, an artificial $\gamma$-fiber texture is defined in terms of a rotationally symmetric Gaussian distribution of deviation angles, which has a certain scatter width along the given $\gamma$-fiber skeleton line in Euler space. The analytic textures are designed by introducing the artificial $\gamma$-fiber texture into the conventional high-strength steel model. The blending coefficient corresponding to the \{111\}/\{001\} volume fraction ratio is selected as the design parameter. Then, an optimum crystallographic texture of steel sheet is found through the limit dome height (LDH) formability tests by employing as objective function, which is evaluated by a maximum thinning ratio of the deformed sheet. Further, it is demonstrated that the sheet with the optimum texture shows the best straining in VDI benchmark stamping tests.},

@article{Ganapathysubramanian2004,
abstract = {The idea of control of mechanical properties in materials through designer processing techniques is promoted through this effort, in contrast to the standard control by alloying. Microstructure evolution through dynamic recrystallization is accurately modelled for the large thermo-mechanical deformation of hyperelastic thermo-viscoplastic materials. An innovative solution strategy and a computational algorithm are presented for the solution of the direct deformation problem comprised of the kinematic, constitutive, contact and thermal sub-problems. The description relies on microstructure based scalar state variables. The formulation follows an approach introduced earlier by Busso [International Journal of Plasticity 14(4–5) (1998) 319] that considers an instability criterion to define the onset of recrystallization. The analysis is performed for hot forming processes and the kinetics of grain growth is controlled by the grain boundary energies and the energy stored through the dislocation density. A finite element implementation is presented and validated with available numerical and experimental results. In addition, an innovative computational framework is developed for the design of deformation processes using the continuum sensitivity method (CSM) incorporating microstructure related state variables. This CSM involves considering the direct continuum equations, design-differentiating them and then evaluating their discretized form. This method differs from common sensitivity techniques in which one design-differentiates the direct discretized equations. The developed method is validated by comparing the computed sensitivities to those obtained through a finite difference scheme. In addition, a gradient-based optimization framework is developed which uses the continuum sensitivity method to evaluate the gradients of the objective functions and constraints. The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated through a number of applications in the design optimization of hot forming processes in the presence of recrystallization and grain growth mechanisms. These examples cover a wide range of applications as they include parameter design (e.g., die design), preform design as well as multi-stage forming design.},

The model is then capable of predicting the texture evolution starting from other initial textures for any specific deformation path. The simulated results from the processing path model agree well with those from the crystal plasticity model.

@article{Berryman2005,
abstract = {Peselnick, Meister, and Watt have developed rigorous methods for bounding elastic constants of random polycrystals based on the Hashin–Shtrikman variational principles. In particular, a fairly complex set of equations that amounts to an algorithm has been presented previously for finding the bounds on effective elastic moduli for polycrystals having hexagonal, trigonal, and tetragonal symmetries. A more analytical approach developed here, although based on the same ideas, results in a new set of compact formulas for all the cases considered. Once these formulas have been established, it is then straightforward to perform what could be considered an analytic continuation of the formulas (into the region of parameter space between the bounds) that can subsequently be used to provide self-consistent estimates for the elastic constants in all cases. This approach is very similar in spirit but differs in its details from earlier work of Willis, showing how Hashin–Shtrikman bounds and certain classes of self-consistent estimates may be related. These self-consistent estimates always lie within the bounds for physical choices of the crystal elastic constants and for all the choices of crystal symmetry considered. For cubic symmetry, the present method reproduces the self-consistent estimates obtained earlier by various authors, but the formulas for both bounds and estimates are generated in a more symmetric form. Numerical values of the estimates obtained this way are also very comparable to those found by the Gubernatis and Krumhansl coherent potential approximation (or CPA), but do not require computations of scattering coefficients.},

@article{Knezevic2010,
abstract = {This paper describes the main results from an experimental investigation into the consequences of deformation twinning in AZ31 on various aspects of plastic deformation, including the anisotropic strain-hardening rates, the tension/compression yield asymmetry, and the evolution of crystallographic texture. It was seen that AZ31 exhibited unusually high normalized strain-hardening rates compared to $\alpha$-Ti that occurred beyond the strain levels where extension twins have completely altered the underlying texture. This observation challenges the validity of the generally accepted notion in the current literature that the high strain-hardening rates in AZ31 are directly caused by extension twins. It is postulated here that the thin contraction twins are very effective in strain hardening of the alloy by restricting the slip length associated with pyramidal 〈c+a〉 slip. This new hypothesis is able to explain the major experimental observations made in this study and in the prior literature. We have also presented a new hypothesis for the physical origin of the observed differences in the thicknesses of the extension and contraction twins. The stress fields in selected matrix–twin configurations were modeled using crystal plasticity finite element models. The contraction twin (01¯11)[01¯12¯] was predicted to form an internal extension twin (011¯2) [01¯11], resulting in the commonly observed “double twin” sequence. The extension twin is suggested to inhibit thickening of this double twin by loss of twin–matrix coherency. Extension twins were predicted to retain their coherency and thus thicken.},

abstract = {A new result presented in this paper is the evaluation of the Hashin–Shtrikman bounds for composites composed of arbitrarily anisotropic constituents. To date, evaluation of the Hashin–Shtrikman bounds are limited to composites with isotropic constituents or to polycrystalline composites with specific crystal symmetries. The generality of the exact result presented herein is achieved through a reinterpretation of Kr\"{o}ner's (J. Mech. Phys. Solids 25 (1977) 137) recursive relations for nth-order bounds and the optimal zeroth-order (n=0) bound. The definitions of optimal zeroth-order bounds are extended to all even-ordered tensors and procedures are presented to evaluate these bounds for all second- and fourth-order tensors. While optimal zeroth-order bounds are not new, the ability to calculate them for fourth-order tensors of arbitrary symmetry is new. Utilizing the zeroth-order bounds, material anisotropy parameters are defined which quantify the extent of anisotropy for even-ordered tensors.},

@article{Liu2014,
abstract = {Incremental sheet forming (ISF) is a promising rapid prototyping technology with high potential to shape complex three-dimensional parts. However, a common technical problem encountered in ISF is the non-uniform thickness distribution of formed parts; particularly excessive thinning on severely sloped regions. This may lead to fracture and limit the process formability. Design of multi-stage deformation passes (intermediate shapes or preforms) before the final part, is a desirable and practical way to control the material flow in order to obtain a more uniform thickness distribution and avoid forming failure. In the present paper, a systematic methodology for designing multi-stage deformation passes considering the predicted thickness strains given the design shape is proposed based on the shear deformation and the strain compensation mechanism. In this methodology, two analytical models (M1 and M2) are developed by taking into account; the global average thickness strain and only the material in the final part region used in the forming (M1), and the local weighted average thickness strain and the additional material around the final part region used in the forming (M2), respectively. The feasibility of the proposed design methodology is validated by finite element analysis (FEA) and experimental tests using an Amino ISF machine. The results show that a more uniform thickness strain distribution can be derived using M2. The incurrence of the highest strains can be delayed in the intermediate stages and the flow of material is allowed into the deformed region, thereby allowing a compressive stress state to develop and enabling steeper shapes to be formed. Therefore, the process formability can be enhanced via the optimized design of deformation passes.},

The material considered is Stabilor®G, a dental alloy, mainly consisting of gold. Tensile tests with microspecimens produced by vacuum pressure casting have been performed using a self-designed universal micro-testing machine. The numerical approach is based on the finite element method with the microstructure being described by a periodic Voronoi tessellation with randomly oriented grains. The analytical approach uses an explicit formulation of the singular approximation in terms of texture coefficients and is valid for arbitrary sample symmetries. It is found that the finite element approach and the analytical approach reproduce the experimental findings. Furthermore, it is shown that the mean value and the standard deviation of Young’s modulus of microspecimens made of cubic crystals subjected to tensile loads can be described by a unified scaling law. The results imply that the statistics of apparent properties of cubic crystal aggregates can be determined using anisotropic effective medium approximations.},

abstract = {The crystallographic texture of the crystalline alpha-chitin matrix in the biological composite material forming the exoskeleton of the lobster Homarus americanus has been determined using synchrotron X-ray pole figure measurements and the calculation of orientation distribution functions. The study has two objectives. The first one is to elucidate crystallographic building principles via the preferred synthesis of certain orientations in crystalline organic tissue. The second one is to study whether a general global design principle exists for the exoskeleton which uses preferred textures relative to the local coordinate system throughout the lobster cuticle. The first point, hence, pursues the question of the extent to which and why alpha-chitin reveals preferred textures in the lobster cuticle. The second point addresses the question of why and whether such preferred textures (and the resulting anisotropy) exist everywhere in the exoskeleton. Concerning the first aspect, a strong preference of a fiber texture of the orthorhombic alpha-chitin is observed which is characterized by a 020 crystal axis normal to the exoskeleton surface for the chitin matrix. The second question is tackled by studying samples from different parts of the carapace. While the first aspect takes a microscopic perspective at the basic structure of the biological composite, the second point aims at building a bridge between an understanding of the microstructure and the macroscopic nature of a larger biological construction. We observe that the texture is everywhere in the carapace optimized in such a way that the same crystallographic axis of the chitin matrix is parallel to the normal to the local tangent plane of the carapace. Notable differences in the texture are observed between hard mineralized parts on the one hand and soft membranous parts on the other. The study shows that the complex hierarchical microstructure of the arthropod cuticle can be well described by surprisingly simple crystallographic textures.},

abstract = {Microstructure Sensitive Design (MSD) is a novel mathematical framework that facilitates development of invertible linkages between statistical description of the material’s microstructure and its effective properties. Property closures are an important outcome of the MSD methodology, and delineate the complete set of theoretically feasible effective (homogenized) anisotropic property combinations in a given material system for a selected homogenization theory. In recent publications, we have reported first-order closures for the elastic and yield properties of both cubic and hexagonal polycrystalline materials. In this paper, we present major extensions to the previously reported framework to enable rigorous consideration of strain hardening and the concomitant evolution of the crystallographic texture with imposed plastic strain. These new extensions facilitate delineation of first-order closures for properties associated with finite plastic strains (e.g. ultimate tensile strength, uniform ductility). The proposed approach has been successfully applied to an aluminum alloy and a copper alloy, and the results are presented and discussed in this paper.},

abstract = {Microstructure sensitive design (MSD) has thus far focused mainly on the identification of the set of microstructures that are theoretically predicted to exhibit a designer-specified combination of elastic–plastic properties. In this paper, we present the extension of the MSD methodology to process design solutions. The goal of process design is to identify a processing route to transform a given initial microstructure into a different microstructure that exhibits superior property combinations by using an arbitrary sequence of available deformation processing options (hereafter referred to as hybrid processing routes). In this paper, we have focused on orientation distribution function (i.e. the 1-point statistics of crystallographic texture in the sample) as the descriptor of microstructure, and considered only the low temperature deformation processes. We have also restricted our attention to Taylor-type crystal plasticity models. With these idealizations, it is shown that it is possible to develop efficient algorithms in the MSD framework to build texture evolution networks that cover most of the texture hull. The advantages of this approach are expounded upon in this paper with selected case studies.},

abstract = {Development of techniques for the control of material properties of polycrystal materials that are inherently dependent on preferred orientations (texture) is addressed. To account for the infinite degrees of freedom of microstructural features, a model reduction on the micro-scale is introduced. Reduced-order models are developed to model the evolution of microstructure described by an orientation distribution function using a finite element discretization of the orientation space. This reduced-order modeling approach is based on the technique of proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) and the method of snapshots. Furthermore, novel design problems are introduced for the control of microstructure based on realistic polycrystalline plasticity. Specifically, a gradient based optimization framework is introduced using a multi-length scale continuum sensitivity method (CSM). The model reduction is extended to the sensitivity analysis and is a key element for the success of computational design of deformation processes. Numerical examples that highlight the benefits of the continuum sensitivity method and model reduction are presented. In addition, the potential of the presented techniques towards process design for obtaining desired material properties is demonstrated with the control at a material point of the elastic modulus in fcc copper. A desired distribution of the elastic modulus is achieved through an optimal selection of the velocity gradient.},

Useful in academic and research contexts, as well as to practitioners in materials engineering and design, it aids readers in producing successful designs by improving the decision-making process in materials selection. It is a constant challenge for designers, even when educated in the fundamentals of materials and mechanical engineering, to select the best materials to satisfy complex design problems. Current approaches to materials selection range from the use of intuition and experience to computer-based methods including electronic databases and search engines. Increasingly, MCDM methods are proving effective in materials selection for complex design problems. These methods supplement existing quantitative methods, such as selection charts, by allowing simultaneous consideration of design attributes, component configurations and types of material.Discusses the rationale for optimal materials selection in the context of achieving the best engineering designDescribes methodologies for supporting enhanced decision-making in materials selectionIncludes end-of-chapter review questions and practical case studies from biomedical and aerospace engineering applications},

abstract = {Material property evolution during processing is governed by the evolution of the underlying microstructure. We present an efficient technique for tailoring texture development and thus, optimizing properties in forming processes involving polycrystalline materials. The deformation process simulator allows simulation of texture formation using a continuum representation of the orientation distribution function. An efficient multi-scale sensitivity analysis technique is then introduced that allows computation of the sensitivity of microstructure field variables such as slip resistances and texture with respect to perturbations in macro-scale forming parameters such as forging rates, die shapes and preform shapes. These sensitivities are used within a gradient-based optimization framework for computational design of material property distribution during metal forming processes. Effectiveness of the developed computational scheme is demonstrated through computationally intensive examples that address control of properties such as Young’s modulus, strength and magnetic hysteresis loss in finished products.},

abstract = {A polycrystalline material, deformed to large plastic strains and subsequently reloaded along a distinct strain path, exhibits a change in flow stress and hardening behavior. Such changes upon reloading depend on the level of mechanical anisotropy induced by texture and sub-grain microstructure developed during prior loading. In order to comprehend such material behavior, we extend a previously developed rate- and temperature-sensitive hardening law for hexagonal single crystals that accounts explicitly for the evolution of dislocation densities by including the effects of reverse dislocation motion and de-twinning on strain hardening and texture evolution. The law is implemented within a visco-plastic self-consistent polycrystalline model and applied to simulate macroscopic behavior of polycrystalline beryllium during strain-path changes. We show that the model successfully captures the mechanical response and evolution of texture and twin volume fraction during pre-loading in compression and subsequent cross-reloading in compression along two orthogonal directions at two different strain rates. These predictions allow us to elucidate the role played by various slip and twin mechanisms, de-twinning, and reverse dislocation motion on strain hardening and texture evolution of beryllium during strain-path changes. The model is general and can be applied to any metal deforming by slip and twinning.},

The foundation of this framework is a visco-plastic self-consistent (VPSC) scheme. We consider a 90° die angle and simulate ECAE up to four passes for four processing routes, (A, C, BA and BC, as denoted in the literature) for an FCC polycrystalline material. We assume that the FCC single crystal has a constant critical resolved shear stress (CRSS), so that hardening by dislocation activity is suppressed, and the influence of grain shape distribution and texture as well as their interaction can be isolated. Many deformation microstructural features, such as grain size and shape distribution, texture, and geometric hardening–softening, were highly dependent on processing route. Using a grain subdivision criterion based on grain shape, route A was the most effective, then route BA and route BC and lastly route C, the least effective for grain size refinement, in agreement with redundant strain theory. For producing refined equiaxed grains, route BC was more effective than routes BA and A. We show that grain–grain interactions tend to weaken texture evolution and consequently geometric hardening and softening in all routes.},

Several common texture components and their combinations were selected and the resulting ear profiles were calculated under consideration of texture changes. The spherical scatter width of the components was also taken into account as an optimization parameter. The study reveals that the ear height and profile can be minimized by an optimized combination of certain texture components including their scatter width. A solution for minimum earing of cup drawn aluminium was obtained for a combination of the S and the Cube texture components with 15° spherical scatter width.},

abstract = {The evolution of crystallographic texture and the mechanical properties of copper subjected to severe plastic deformation (SPD) using equal channel angular pressing (ECAP) were investigated. Samples were subjected to ECAP under two different processing routes: B60 and BC. As the cross sections of the samples were circular, a new route with a rotation angle of 60° in the same direction between consecutive passes was introduced. The material exhibited texture development similar to the simple shear texture in both routes and the most significant changes in texture strength in both processing routes took place after the second pass. Microstructure of ECAP processed samples were investigated using electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) analysis. Comparison of the EBSD data with optical micrograph of the initial sample confirmed that ECAP process has led to a significant decrease in grain size. Significant increases in hardness and tensile strength were observed after the first pass of ECAP. Variations of tensile strength as a function of the number of passes were related to the dislocation densities and the average boundary spacing.},

abstract = {Methods of analysis and design for inelastic deformation processes with random input parameters are exposed. Stochastic analysis makes use either of function evaluations for a synthetic statistical input sample (Monte Carlo technique) or of a Taylor-series expansion of the response around the mean input. The latter relates to the perturbation method, extended over the duration of the deformation process following temporal integration. Tasks concerning process design are defined and the employment of the stochastic analysis techniques is discussed for exploring the parameter space as well as for design improvement and optimization. The suitability of either analysis technique for performing the particular tasks is pointed out. The design problem raises the issue of robustness to input scatter. Robust optimization respects both the mean and the variance of the design objective via the desirability function, a weighted combination of the two quantities. The exploration potential of synthetic sampling is demonstrated by an application where sensitivity-based techniques prove inadequate because of the local nature of the approximation.},
